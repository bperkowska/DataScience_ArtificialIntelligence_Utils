text = "The Inflation Reduction Act lowers prescription drug costs, health care costs, and energy costs. It's the most aggressive action on tackling the climate crisis in American history, which will lift up American workers and create good-paying, union jobs across the country. It'll lower the deficit and ask the ultra-wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share. And no one making under $400,000 per year will pay a penny more in taxes."

text = "Dear Amazon, last week I ordered an Optimus Prime action figure from your online store in Germany. Unfortunately, when I opened the package, I discovered to my horror that I had been sent an action figure of Megatron instead! As a lifelong enemy of the Decepticons, I hope you can understand my dilemma. To resolve the issue, I demand an exchange of Megatron for the Optimus Prime figure I ordered. Enclosed are copies of my records concerning this purchase. I expect to hear from you soon. Sincerely, Bumblebee."
